/// \brief The NatPunchthrough class implements the NAT punch through technique, allowing two systems to connect to each other that are both behind NATs.
///
/// A NAT (Network Address Translator) is a system that will makes it so your system's IP address is different from the IP address exposed to the internet.
/// This provides some security and allows multiple computers, each with a different IP address, to share one IP address as seen by the internet.
///
/// The problem is that NATs also ignore packets sent to them unless they sent a packet to the sender first.
/// If two systems are both behind NATs, then neither system can connect to each other.
/// Furthermore, some NATs will impose a temporary ban on an IP address that send unsolicited packets to them.
///
/// This can be solved by using a third system, a facilitator, that is not behind a NAT and that both systems are already connected to.
/// It will synchronize a send between both NAT systems such that the routers will both consider themselves as handling a reply to a message, when in
/// fact they are handing an initial message.  As replies are allowed, both systems get their corresponding messages and the connection takes place.
/// S = system that wants to connect
/// F = facilitator
/// R = system to get the connection request.
///
/// S knows IP of R in advance.
/// 1. S->F facilitate connection request to R
/// 2. if (R is not is connected) F->S ID_NAT_TARGET_NOT_CONNECTED.  Exit.
/// 3. F -> (Ping S, Ping R), every X ms Y times.  Wait Max(Ping(s), Ping(r) * multiple ms more, then go to step 4.
/// 4. F picks time highest(ave of Ping R,S) * N from now and sends this time RELIABLE and timestamped to R,S.
/// 5. At time picked in (4), S attempts to connect to R.  R sends offline ping to S.
/// 6. If R disconnects before or at step 4, tell this to S via ID_NAT_TARGET_CONNECTION_LOST
///
/// \note Timing is important with this plugin.  You need to call RakPeer::Receive frequently.
