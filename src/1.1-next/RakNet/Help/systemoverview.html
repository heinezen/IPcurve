System Architecture</font></strong><p>
<font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#666666"><b>RakPeer.h</b> provides the base 
functionality for all of RakNet.&nbsp; On start, RakPeer starts a thread that 
will process all incoming datagrams and send most outgoing datagrams.&nbsp; A 
shared memory array of RemoteSystem structures is shared between the user thread 
and the network thread.&nbsp; Messages are sent between these two threads using 
a fast single producer single consumer object.&nbsp; Each player has one entry 
in the array of RemoteSystem structures.&nbsp; Each element in the array has an 
instance of the ReliabilityLayer class, which handles reliable sends, ordering, 
and integrates with the message security classes.&nbsp; As user messages arrive, 
they are stored a single producer single consumer queue.&nbsp; When a user wants 
a message, by calling Receive(), this will return a pointer to one element of 
the queue.&nbsp; When a user is done with a message, by calling DeallocatePacket(), 
this will increment the write pointer of the queue.&nbsp; This is why you have 
to return messages in the same order as you get them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#666666">Calling Receive() also does any 
user-thread based processing.&nbsp; One case of this is <b>RakNet's plugin 
system.</b>&nbsp; The plugin system is just an interface (PluginInterface.h) 
that has hooks inside RakPeer to perform certain functionality on certain 
events.&nbsp; The biggest two are Update() and the processing of packets in 
OnReceive(), both of which happen when the user calls RakPeer::Receive().&nbsp; 
This has two advantages.&nbsp; First, you don't have to keep track of which 
plugin modules you are using.&nbsp; Second, if a plugin module has its own 
message types, those message types can be processed in the plugin and blocked 
from being returned from Receive().&nbsp; Hence, your application can add 
modular functionality with no code changes beyond adding the plugin itself.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#666666">RakNet's messaging system works 
by treating the first byte of any message as an identifier indicating the format 
and meaning of the rest of the data in the message.&nbsp; The message id bytes 
used by RakNet are stored in the file MessageIdentifiers.h.&nbsp; Users that 
want to extend this system can start their own enumerations starting at the 
highest enumeration in MessageIdentifiers.h + 1.&nbsp; Users would then check 
the first byte of messages that are returned to them and call a function to 
handle the rest of the data in the message.&nbsp; To make this easier, RakNet 
supports <b>remote function calls</b>.&nbsp; Essentially, remote function calls 
perform this mapping for you by registering a string with a function pointer.&nbsp; 
You then call RakPeer::RPC with the name of the function and if the other side 
has that function registered, it will call the function pointer along with a 
structure containing data such as encoded parameters and who sent the message.&nbsp; 
This system has two further extensions.&nbsp; First, it supports return values 
by blocking in the Receive() call until a message is returned or until a timeout 
elapses.&nbsp; Second, it supports calling into object member functions, not 
just static C functions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#666666">The <b>NetworkIDObject</b> 
class provides the ability for systems to refer to common objects and is used by 
object member remote function calls.&nbsp; It is a fairly simple system that has 
the server assign a number to objects as they are created.&nbsp; When a client 
creates an object, it is responsible for sending this event to the server, 
getting the number to use when the object is created on the server in turn, and 
then assigning this number to the object.&nbsp; This way systems can refer to 
objects on multiple systems which would otherwise be impossible since pointer 
addresses would probably not be the same.&nbsp; The easiest way to use this 
system is to derive from it.&nbsp; However, you can also include it as a member 
variable of your base class and call SetParent(parentClassPointer).&nbsp; The 
disadvantage of this architecture is that it relies on a single system being 
present to assign network IDs.&nbsp; This can be addressed by having <b>
NetworkID</b>s be a <b>SystemAddress / NetworkID </b>pair instead of a simple number.&nbsp; 
However, that takes more bandwidth which would be wasted in server/client 
topology, which happens to be the most common case.&nbsp; It is currently 
implemented using a single number.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#666666">The <b>
<a href="systemaddresses.html">SystemAddress</a></b> structure is what RakNet uses to 
represent remote systems.&nbsp; It is the binary encoding of the IP address 
along with the port of that system.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#666666">The <b>
<a href="bitstreams.html">BitStream</a></b> class, located in BitStream.h, is 
natively supported by RakNet.&nbsp; This is both a user class and an internal 
class.&nbsp; It is primarily used to write single bits to a stream and for 
automatic endian swapping, which can be enabled by commenting out&nbsp; __BITSTREAM_NATIVE_END 
in RakNetDefines.h.&nbsp; It is disabled by default for speed, since most users do 
not need endian swapping.</font></p>

These are the classes and files designed to be used by the user.&nbsp; All other 
classes and files are internal, or are in support of these classes.&nbsp; All 
user classes are extensively documented in the header file so you should look 
there for function level documentation.&nbsp; In every case you can find the 
class inside the header file of the same name.</font></p>
