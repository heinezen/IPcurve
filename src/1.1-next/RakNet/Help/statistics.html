</strong></FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT FACE="Geneva, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" CLASS="G10" COLOR="#666666">
Statistical data is important for an online game because it lets you see where your traffic bottlenecks are.  To this end, Raknet provides the structure RakNetStatistics which is returned by the GetStatistics() function present in RakPeerInterface.  This structure is defined in <I>Source/RakNetStatistics.h</I>.  The function StatisticsToString is also provided which will convert these statistics to a formatted buffer.<BR>

<FONT FACE="Geneva, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" CLASS="G10" COLOR="#3366CC"><strong>Terms used
</strong></FONT><BR><BR>
<B>CRC</B> - Cyclic Redundancy Check data used with encrypted messages to detect tampering.<BR>
<B>Encryption bits</B> - Extra data in the header that is used solely for encryption headers and block alignment required for encryption.<BR>
<B>Resend queue</B> - A queue of reliable messages waiting for acknowlegements.<BR>
<B>Split message</B> - A block of data that is a segment of a larger block of data.  The original message is split if it is larger than the MTU when accounting for headers from RakNet and UDP.<BR>
<B>Message</B> - A block of data to be sent.<BR>
<B>Packet</B> - A packet contains zero or more acknowlegements and zero or more messages, at least one of either.<BR>

<I>Zero value:</I> Normal performance.<BR>
<BR>
<B>unsigned acknowlegementsSent;</B><BR>
<I>Description:</I> Number of acknowlegements sent for reliable messages.  Each reliable message recieved generates one acknowlegement, including resends.<BR>

<B>unsigned packetsContainingOnlyAcknowlegementsAndResends;</B><BR>
<I>Description:</I> Number of packets that have been sent that contain only acknowlegements and resends.<BR>

<BR>
<B>unsigned messageResends;</B><BR>
<I>Description:</I> Number of messages that were not acknowleged in time so were resent.  This is equivalent to packetloss.<BR>

<BR>
<B>unsigned messagesWaitingForReassembly;</B><BR>
<I>Description:</I> How many split messages are waiting to be completed.<BR>
